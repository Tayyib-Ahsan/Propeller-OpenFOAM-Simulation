This repository showcases a simulation from my research projects.

The boundary type of outerCylinder is changed from 'wall' type to 'symmetry' type using a python script. Users are recommended to use the Allrun script with Python3 downloaded.

This simulation is done at advance coefficient (J) 0.534. The VP1304 propeller was used for this simulation.

The mesh is by no means optimum. This was just a rough start.

Thank You !!!
